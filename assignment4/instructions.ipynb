    "Build **kNN** and **logistic regression** classifiers using sklearn library to predict \"passed\" (label variable) by using given data. \n",
    "- Start the project with data processing such as converting non-numeric values to numerical ones,  data normalization, etc.\n",
    "- Explore and analyze the data using feature visualization such as correlation heatmap, and distribution plots by commenting on your findings. Choose min. 3 features for the visualization step. \n",
    "- Then, shuffle and split your data into train and test sets randomly, with a ratio of 70:30. (Write your own shuffling and spliting code, do not use predefined function train_test_split).\n",
    "- Build your models (with proper comments and explanations) using the training set.\n",
    "- Compare these 2 classification models according to their accuracies (you can print accuracy values in a single table as a comprehensive view) over the test set. Comment on their classification performance.\n",
    "- Plot confusion matrices for your models over the test set, and comment on the outcomes. \n",
    "- Finally, plot Precision-Recall (PR) curves for each classification model over the test set and evaluate/comment the prediction performance of each classifier. \n",
